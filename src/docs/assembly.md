# Assembly

The `Assembly` data type corresponds to an assembled sequence comprised of aligned reads

| Field             | Type            | Description
|-------------------|-----------------|---------------------
| type              | string          | Assembly
| id                | string          | The accession provided by the assembly creator
| name              | string          | The name provided by the assembly creator
| accession_id      | string          | Name provided by an accessioning body
| accessioning_body | string          | The independent assigner of an identity to the assembly
| species           | Species         | The species entity to which many assemblies may belong
| default           | Boolean         | The "best" assembly for the species, for when the user does not want to choose

## Notes
1. Not all assemblies have yet been recognised by accessioning bodies like INSDC, so the accession_id and accessioning_body may be null

## Example
```
{
  "type": "Assembly",
  "id": "GRCh38.p13",
  "name": "GRCh38",
  "accession_id": "GCA_000001405.14",
  "accessioning_body": "EGA",
  "species": "Human"
  "default": True
}
```
